# QWERTY-machine-learning

This code creates a simple machine learning program that trains a model on a list of training data and uses the model to make predictions on new data.  The DataPoint class represents a single data point in the training data. Each data point has an x and y value, as well as a label indicating the class that the data point belongs to.
